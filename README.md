* **QA Engineer**: Ensures the backend functionalities are thoroughly tested and meet quality standards.

## Technology Stack

* **Django**: A high-level Python web framework used for building the RESTful API.
* **Django** REST Framework: Provides tools for creating and managing RESTful APIs.
* **PostgreSQL**: A powerful relational database used for data storage.
* **GraphQL**: Allows for flexible and efficient querying of data.
* **Celery**: For handling asynchronous tasks such as sending notifications or processing payments.
* **Redis**: Used for caching and session management.
* **Docker**: Containerization tool for consistent development and deployment environments.
* **CI/CD Pipelines**: Automated pipelines for testing and deploying code changes.

## Database Design

* ### Users

  * id
  * username
  * email
  * password

* ### Properties: A user can have multiple properties

  * id
  * user_id
  * property_name

* ### Booking: A user does the booking on a property

  * id
  * property_id
  * user_id

* ### Reviews: A user makes a review on a property

  * id
  * user_id
  * property_id
  * review_score
  * review_message

* ### Payments: A user pays for a booking on a property

  * id
  * booking_id
  * user_id
  * transaction_number

## Feature Breakdown

* **User Management**:  
  * Handles account creation, authentication, and profile management for both guests and hosts.  
  * Ensures secure access control, making it easy for users to manage their bookings, listings, and personal details in one place.  
  * Connects with property management, booking, and review systems so every action is tied to a verified user identity.  

* **Property Management**:  
  * Allows hosts to create, update, and manage property listings with details like pricing, availability, and amenities.  
  * Helps keep listings organized and accurate, ensuring guests can find properties that match their preferences.  
  * Works closely with the booking system to prevent double-bookings and with the review system to display property reputations.  

* **Booking System**:  
  * Facilitates real-time reservation of properties, including availability checks and calendar synchronization.  
  * Provides a smooth booking flow, improving user experience and maximizing host occupancy rates.  
  * Ties into payment processing for transaction confirmation and into property management to automatically update availability.  

* **Payment Processing**:  
  * Enables secure transactions between guests and hosts through integrated payment gateways.  
  * Automates payment confirmations, refunds, and payouts, building trust and streamlining financial operations.  
  * Links directly with the booking system to confirm reservations only after successful payment and integrates with user management for transaction history.  

* **Review System**:  
  * Allows guests to leave feedback and ratings after stays, helping maintain transparency and trust.  
  * Encourages hosts to maintain high-quality services while guiding future guests in their decision-making.  
  * Connects with user management (to verify reviewers), booking (to allow only real guests to leave reviews), and property management (to attach reviews to listings).  

* **Data Optimization**:  
  * Uses analytics and algorithms to recommend properties based on user preferences and booking history.  
  * Improves search speed, personalization, and overall platform performance for both guests and hosts.  
  * Relies on data from all other features—user behavior, property details, booking patterns, and reviews—to create a smarter, more engaging platform.  

## API Security

* **Authentication**  
  * Implementation: Use secure methods such as JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or OAuth 2.0 for login and session management, along with optional two-factor authentication (2FA).  
  * Why it’s crucial: Prevents unauthorized access and protects user accounts, ensuring that sensitive information like personal details and booking history remain safe.  

* **Authorization**  
  * Implementation: Role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure that only hosts can manage listings, only guests can book, and admins can monitor the platform.  
  * Why it’s crucial: Prevents privilege escalation and misuse of the system, ensuring users can only perform actions they are legitimately allowed to.  

* **Rate Limiting**  
  * Implementation: Limit the number of login attempts, API requests, or transactions per user/IP in a given timeframe.  
  * Why it’s crucial: Protects against brute-force attacks, spam, and denial-of-service (DoS) attempts that could compromise availability or system performance.  

* **Data Encryption**  
  * Implementation: Use HTTPS/TLS for all network communication and encrypt sensitive data (e.g., passwords, payment details) at rest with algorithms like AES-256.  
  * Why it’s crucial: Ensures that user data and payment information cannot be intercepted or stolen during transmission or if the database is compromised.

## CI/CD Pipelines
  
  CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) pipelines are automated workflows that build, test, and deploy code whenever changes are made. CI ensures new code is regularly integrated and tested, while CD automates deployment to staging or production environments.  

* **Why they are important**:  
  They help maintain code quality by automatically running tests and checks before merging changes. This reduces bugs, speeds up development, and ensures new features or fixes are delivered to users quickly and reliably without downtime. For a project like an Airbnb clone, CI/CD guarantees that updates to critical features (like booking or payments) are safe and consistent.  

* **Tools that can be used**:  
  * **GitHub Actions** or **GitLab CI/CD**: for automating build, test, and deployment workflows.  
  * **Docker**: for containerizing the app to ensure it runs consistently across different environments.  
  * **Kubernetes**: for scaling and managing containerized deployments in production.  
  * **Jenkins**: an alternative for highly customizable CI/CD automation.  
  * **AWS CodePipeline / Azure DevOps / CircleCI**: cloud-based CI/CD solutions that integrate with hosting environments.
